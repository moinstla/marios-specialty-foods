# Mario's Specialty Foods

#### Ruby on Rails Basics Independent Project 6/30/2017

#### By Monique St. Laurent

This is a website for a gourmet food store, built using Ruby on Rails. It uses an Active Record database to store product information, and reviews, which allows users to view, add, update and delete items. Validations and callbacks are used to make sure that information in the database is properly saved and formatted. Scopes are also used to display products that meet certain criteria.
